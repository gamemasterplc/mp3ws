Mario Party 3 Widescreen Patch
===============
This repository implements widescreen for Mario Party 3.

Build Requirements
-------------
Building these sources requires:

* An installation of Windows 10 or Windows 11.
* Clean Mario Party 3 ROM

Building the Source
-------------
Place a clean copy of the Mario Party 3 ROM (US version) in the root directory, name it "mp3.z64", and run "build_mp3ws.bat" to build.

Running
-------------
The output of building will be named "mp3ws.z64" and will be slightly smaller than the input ROM. It is tested with Project64 and ares. Project64 will need the save type set to 16-kbit EEPROM for saving to work.
